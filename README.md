I'm a Progrunner—a programmer by passion and a runner by determination. By day, I write clean code and debug complex problems; by night (or whenever I can squeeze in the miles), I hit the pavement, chasing new personal bests. Whether I’m optimizing algorithms or my race pace, I thrive on the challenge of improvement. I love the balance of mental endurance in coding and physical endurance in running—both pushing me to be better, one step and one line of code at a time. 🚀🏃‍♂️
